## Project Description
The **Skill Assessment System** is a desktop-based quiz application designed for college students to evaluate their knowledge through interactive quizzes. Built using **Java Swing** and adhering to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, the application offers a modular, maintainable, and user-friendly interface. It includes features like user authentication, quiz navigation, rule display, and score tracking.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java 8+
- **GUI Framework**: Java Swing
- **IDE**: NetBeans IDE
- **Other**: Object-Oriented Programming principles

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system for students to access the quiz.
- **Quiz Interface**: Interactive quiz module with questions and multiple-choice options.
- **Rules Display**: Clear instructions and rules presented before starting the quiz.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the user's score upon quiz completion.
- **Modular Design**: Codebase structured using OOP for easy maintenance and scalability.
